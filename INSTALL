Yaplot 3.0 requires gtk, and for additional recording facility,
gdk-pixbuf is also required.

After those libraries are installed, simply type the following commands:

% ./configure
% make

If you failed to find gtk library, try the following:

% make -f Makefile.autoconf
% export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig
% ./configure
% make



Install them with the command,

# make install


Have fun!
