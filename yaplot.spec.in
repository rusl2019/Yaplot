%description
      Yaplot is an easy 3D modeller and animator
      for visualizing the results from computer
      simulation easily.
      You can browse the motion of the 3 dimentional wire frame model
      with text labels and
      some marks on the cheap PC based X terminals.
      Data format is simple and intuitive.
      It is the least beautiful and not durable for presentation, but
      quick and smooth enough for daily use.
