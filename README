     * What is yaplot?
    Features of Yaplot
          + Simple appearance
          + Simple and universal data style
          + Easy animation
       Yaplot is an easy 3D modeller and animator for visualizing the
       results from computer simulation easily. You can browse the motion
       of the 3 dimentional wire frame model with text labels and some
       marks on the cheap PC based X terminals. Data format is simple and
       intuitive. It is the least beautiful and not durable for
       presentation, but enough quick and smooth for daily use. (Do not
       expect much to yaplot!)
     * Installation GTK+ library is necessary for compilation. gtk
       library is available at ****, or install by your OS's package
       installer. To install Yaplot on unix system, extract the source
       code and type simply,
      % make -f Makefile.unix install
       will produce yaplot, the execulable file.
     * Invoking Yaplot
         1. Prepare the yaplot command, data file (e.g. [4]test.mol), and
            the palette file ([5]yaplot.col). The name of the palette
            file must be "yaplot.col".
         2. Type
            % yaplot test.mol
            on the command line.
       Another [6]sample script "perc.pl" is also available, which
       visualizes 3-dimensional percolation in a periodical box (shown at
       the top of this page) by just typing:
       % perc.pl | yaplot -
     * Command Line Usage
usage : yaplot [options] infiles...
        -e x,y,z        set eyepoint
        -l x,y,z        set lookpoint
        -u x,y,z        set upvector
        -c filename     specify palette file(default: yaplot.col)
        -C n            cache n frames on the memory (will speed up animation)
        infiles         multiple command files
       You can specify single "-" for command file, which means stdin.
       Multiple frame animation is, however, not available because stdin
       cannot be accessed randomly by fseek().
       If you do not specify the palette file, "yaplot.col" in current
       directory is searched. If not found, the environment variable
       "YAPLOTCOL" is used instead. If not found, "yaplot.col" in your
       home directory will be used.
       When the command is invoked, a 512x512 window is displayed. You
       can rotate, translate, or proceed frames by keys.
       Eye point conversion rule is just same as that used in Rayshade.
       You can easily convert coordinate data into rayshade format.
     * Command keys
       
        Up and Down Arrows
                Pitching rotation. Press again and again if you want to
                rotate quicker.
                
        Left and Right Arrows
                Heading rotation.
                
        Drag by Mouse
                Immediate rotation.
                
        Pause
                Stop rotation.
                
        Tab
                Reset rotations.

                Next frame ( Animated if key is shifted. )
                
        PageUp or "p"
                Previous frame
                
        number keys followed by "g" or Enter
                Jump to the specified frame.
                
        SPACE
                Stop all motions.
                
        "+" or "-"
                Change image quality.
                
        Insert or Delete
                Change the Line width.
                
        "q" or Break
                Quit yaplot.
                
        Function keys, or number keys followed by "f"
                Toggle layers.
                
     * Data file format All command lines in the data file are made of
       the single command character at the first column, followed by
       parameters. No parameters can be omitted. You can easily make the
       data file by Fortran or other scripting languages.
       
   r {radius} Specify the radius of the circle, ring, and stick
   l {x} {y} {z} {x} {y} {z} Draw a line
   s {x} {y} {z} {x} {y} {z} Draw a stick
   p {x} {y} {z} {x} {y} {z} {x} {y} {z} ... Draw a filled polygon
   c {x} {y} {z} Draw a circle
   o {x} {y} {z} Draw a ring mark
   3 {x} {y} {z} Draw a small triangle mark
   4 {x} {y} {z} Draw a small square mark
   5 {x} {y} {z} Draw a small pentagon mark
   6 {x} {y} {z} Draw a small hexagon mark
   t {x} {y} {z} {text....} Draw a string
   @ {palette} Change the current palette
   # {comment} Comment(ignored)
   NULL line End of a frame
     * Palette file format Each line of the palette file specifies the
       Red, Green and Blue intensity of the pallete. First line describes
       the color for palette 0. As the palettes 0 to 2 are reserved for
       system color (Black, Gray, and White), you should not modify them.
